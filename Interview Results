Do you/someone you know own an Electric Vehicle? Yes (Tesla)

How do you find managing your vehicle remotely?
I love it, honestly. The Tesla app is incredibly user-friendly. I can preheat or cool the car, check battery status, plan routes—it’s really convenient and makes you feel connected to the vehicle. It’s especially handy during winter when I can defrost my car from my kitchen.

Do you/someone you know own a smart home system? Yes

How do you find managing your smart home remotely?
It’s fantastic. I use Google Home to control lights, thermostat, and even some appliances. Being able to control things from my phone or with my voice saves time and feels futuristic. Plus, it helps save on energy bills.

Is managing your EV/Smart Home remotely an important thing to you? And would you take an opportunity to do so if given?
Absolutely. It’s not just about convenience, it’s about efficiency. If there’s a way to centralize control even more, I’d be first in line to try it.

Do you/someone you know own solar panels? Yes

How much use do you get out of the solar panels? They power about 60–70% of our home.

How much on average were your solar panels? Around £6,000 after government grants.

Do you know what a carbon footprint is? Yes

Have you ever been curious to know your carbon footprint and improve it? Yes

How much should an app cost which would handle all of this information together? Around £5–£10/month.

Would you personally consider installing this app to use its features? Why / Why not?
Definitely. If it combines all my smart tech into one interface and shows me how it affects my footprint, that’s value. It would help me make even more informed decisions.

Do you/someone you know own an Electric Vehicle? No

Have you previously thought about getting an Electric Vehicle? Why / Why Not?
I’ve thought about it, but they’re just too expensive right now, especially for someone like me who’s still in uni. Plus, I live in shared housing and we don't have a driveway or access to a charger.

Do you/someone you know own a smart home system? No

Have you previously thought about getting a smart home system? Why / Why Not?
It sounds cool, but it feels unnecessary for my lifestyle right now. I rent, so I can’t install much. Also, it seems like it’d only be useful if you have a lot of gadgets.

Do you/someone you know own solar panels? No

What has put you off from getting solar panels?
Mainly the cost and the fact that I don’t own a house. I think they’re a great idea, but you need the right setup. Plus, there's confusion about how long it takes to actually save money.

If you were able to get solar panels without this issue would you? Yes

Do you know what a carbon footprint is? Yes

Have you ever been curious to know your carbon footprint and improve it? Yes

How much should an app cost which would handle all of this information together? Maybe free or up to £2/month.

Would you personally consider installing this app to use its features? Why / Why not?
Yeah, if it’s free or cheap. I like learning about how I can live more sustainably, but I wouldn’t pay much unless it gave real insights that apply to my situation.

Do you/someone you know own an Electric Vehicle? No

Have you previously thought about getting an Electric Vehicle? Why / Why Not?
We’ve talked about it, but we’re not fully convinced yet. Charging infrastructure in our area isn’t the best, and we don’t drive as much anymore, so it doesn’t seem worth the switch right now.

Do you/someone you know own a smart home system? Yes

How do you find managing your smart home remotely?
It’s helpful, but we don’t use all the features. Mostly just for turning lights on and off, or adjusting heating when we’re away. My son set it up, so there was a learning curve, but now it’s handy.

Is managing your EV/Smart Home remotely an important thing to you? And would you take an opportunity to do so if given?
Yes, convenience is key at our age. If an app could bring it all together and make it even simpler, we’d definitely give it a try.

Do you/someone you know own solar panels? No

What has put you off from getting solar panels?
Honestly, we’re worried about the return on investment at our age. It would take years to make our money back, and the upfront cost is a bit intimidating.

If you were able to get solar panels without this issue would you? Yes

Do you know what a carbon footprint is? Yes

Have you ever been curious to know your carbon footprint and improve it? Yes

How much should an app cost which would handle all of this information together? £3/month or free with ads.

Would you personally consider installing this app to use its features? Why / Why not?
Yes, if it’s easy to use and doesn’t require too much setup. We’re not very tech-savvy, but we’d like to do our part and keep things convenient.

Do you/someone you know own an Electric Vehicle? No

Have you previously thought about getting an Electric Vehicle? Why / Why Not?
Not really. We live too far from town, and I don’t trust the battery range. Plus, the prices are too high and maintenance sounds complicated.

Do you/someone you know own a smart home system? No

Have you previously thought about getting a smart home system? Why / Why Not?
I think they’re just gimmicks. I don’t want my house connected to the internet or relying on an app to do basic things.

Do you/someone you know own solar panels? No

What has put you off from getting solar panels?
Mostly the cost and installation hassle. I’ve heard mixed things about whether they actually save you money. Plus, I don’t like the look of them on the roof.

If you were able to get solar panels without this issue would you? No

Do you know what a carbon footprint is? Yes

Have you ever been curious to know your carbon footprint and improve it? No

How much should an app cost which would handle all of this information together? Nothing—I wouldn’t use it.

Would you personally consider installing this app to use its features? Why / Why not?
No thanks. I like to keep things simple and private. Apps tracking all that stuff just sound invasive to me.

Do you/someone you know own an Electric Vehicle? Yes (Nissan Leaf)

How do you find managing your vehicle remotely?
It’s okay. The app could be better—sometimes it lags or doesn’t connect. But being able to see the battery level and set charging times is really useful. It gives me a sense of control over my energy use.

Do you/someone you know own a smart home system? No

Have you previously thought about getting a smart home system? Why / Why Not?
Yes, definitely. I’m waiting till I move into a more permanent place. I’d love to automate heating and lights for both comfort and sustainability reasons.

Totally. It’s about maximizing efficiency and reducing waste. I’d love an app that puts it all in one dashboard.

Do you/someone you know own solar panels? No

What has put you off from getting solar panels?
I rent, so I don’t have the authority to install them. If I owned a home, they’d be one of my first upgrades.

If you were able to get solar panels without this issue would you? Yes

Do you know what a carbon footprint is? Yes

Have you ever been curious to know your carbon footprint and improve it? Yes

How much should an app cost which would handle all of this information together? £4.99/month or a one-off payment.

Yes, absolutely. If it helps track my impact and connects to my EV and future smart home, it’s worth it. It would make sustainable living easier to manage.
