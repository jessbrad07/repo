# Revision

## DATA REQUIREMENTS
Diagrams Needed:

Data Dictionary

Enitity-Relationship Diagram

Data Flow Diagram


MUST INCLUDE ERROR HANDLING DETAILS

#### Error Handling:

Data Validation
Type Casting
Maximum Field Length
Feedback to users/error messages

#### Algorithm Designs

Must talk about Key Processes like the following:

Handling user access (Accounts, Changing Passwords)

Creation and Processing of data (inputting data, storing data, changing information)

Communication/data exchange (passing things between front and back end, e.g. displaying items from databases)

##### Algorithms

Many algorithms needed. Will be 1 for each main section of the site. 

Expected Features:

Clearly Defined Steps

Clear Logic

Efficiency, no unnecessary steps or loops

Modularity, allowing the algorithm to be reused.

#### Test Table

Unit Testing

Integration Testing

System Testing

User Acceptance Testing
-----------------------------------------------------
Clearly define what each component is and what it is responsible for

Explain how the component interacts with other parts of the solution

Specific Testing Techniques:

Functional + Non-functional Testing

Regression Testing

Security Testing

#### Legislation

Regulatory Guidelines: Discuss how your solution will adhere to relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements for the industry or context. 

Privacy Concerns: How will you protect user data in the context of the scenario? 

User Errors: What measures will you implement to prevent user mistakes, particularly for vulnerable user groups? 

Intellectual Property: Address how you will ensure the proper use of any content or materials relevant to the occupational scenario.
